      <h1 style="font-family: cursive; color: blue; font-size: 40px;">Why to adopt a dog?</h1> <br>
      <h3> <em> Deciding to adopt a rescue pet or shelter dog is an important decision. It can be tough to take into
          account
          everything you’ll need to be prepared for (both expected and unexpected), but the rewards of adopting a
          four-legged friend outweigh most concerns and fears many people have concerning adoption. Still not convinced?
          See our top 5 reasons to adopt: </em> </h3> <br>
      <h3>1. You’re Saving More Than One Life</h3> <br>
      <h4 style="color: #333;">It goes without saying that when you adopt a rescue pet, you’re saving a life—but you’re
        actually saving more
        than one. By adopting, you’re helping make space for another animal in need and helping to give them the
        opportunity to become beloved pets. </h4> <br>
      <h3>2. Unconditional Love! What Could Be Better?</h3> <br>
      <h4 style="color: #333;">Many people worry about connecting with a rescued dog, but shelter dogs have so much love
        to give—and they
        won’t ever stop giving it to you once you let them into your heart!</h4> <br>
      <h3>3. You’re Giving a Second Chance to a Deserving Animal </h3> <br>
      <h4 style="color: #333;">Beyond just helping an animal in need, you’re giving a rescue an opportunity to find
        their voice; to be
        themselves and get a second chance to become a dog beyond the walls of shelter or rescue. You truly give them
        the keys to start anew in a life where second chances can often be hard to come by. </h4> <br>
      <h3>4. You Get a Chance to Stay Active</h3> <br>
      <h4 style="color: #333;">Maybe you’re trying to live a more active lifestyle, or maybe you’re just looking for a
        new adventure. Either
        way, a new four-legged friend gives you a reason to get outdoors more and stretch your legs!</h4> <br>
      <h3>5. You Have Someone New to Shop For </h3> <br>
      <h4 style="color: #333;">It’s always fun to spoil your pets and bringing home a new furry family member gives you
        a reason to do just
        that. You can enjoy all the retail therapy you want while making sure your new rescue dog is living in the lap
        of luxury.</h4> <br>

        <p style="font-size: large;">Good nutrition is feeding your dog the building blocks and energy components that
          allow them to grow, develop
          to their potential and stay active throughout their life. There are many ways to feed your dog and hundreds of
          diets to choose from. Most people tend to use dry and canned dog food for convenience and cost. However, for
          owners who are open minded about their dog's diet, there are alternatives to dry and canned dog food that may
          offer better nutrition for your particular dog.</p>

      <h1 style="font-family: cursive; color: blue; font-size: 40px;">Groomings</h1> <br>
      <h2><em>1.
          Gather your grooming materials.</em><br><br> You don't want to be looking for your tools once you begin
        grooming
        your
        dog. Make sure to have everything you need in one place before you begin the task at hand. Consult the "Things
        You'll Need" section below to find out what you'll need to groom your dog.</h2><br>
      <h2> <em> 2.
          Comb out your dog first.</em><br><br> Combing your dog's coat daily or every other day will keep most mats at
        bay.
        Simply brushing, as most literature instructs, is not enough for dogs that can mat up: the brush will easily
        pass over at angles that a comb will get stuck on. A thorough combing should always be the first step of the
        grooming process because any mats will become tighter and less manageable once they dry. Begin on the head and
        move down the body. Be careful under the belly, as it is a sensitive area, and don't forget to comb the tail.
      </h2><br>
      <h2><em> 3.
          Praise your dog as you're brushing.</em><br><br> Reward calm, quiet behavior to encourage more of it. You may
        want
        to include
        a treat to reward the dog for good behavior.</h2><br>
      <h2><em> 4.
          Give the dog breaks as needed. </em><br><br> You don't want the dog to get overwhelmed; any negative
        associations
        can make
        grooming harder in the future. Make the experience fun by giving your pet breaks from time to time, giving
        praise, treats, pets, and even a little bit of play. This will also keep your dog distracted.</h2><br>
      <h2><em> 5.
          Cut out mats that can't be brushed out. </em> <br><br> Severe matting can pull the skin every time the dog
        moves,
        making daily
        life painful for your pet. If you can't brush a mat out, you need to either cut or shave it off, depending on
        how close it is to the skin. Be extremely careful if you use scissors to avoid injuring yourself or your pet.
        Try to cut parallel to the growth of the hair to avoid a choppy look.</h2><br>
